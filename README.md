Manifestation means using our thoughts and feelings like energy to make our wishes come true. It's like putting fuel in a car to make it go. One important rule is to never give up, even until the very last moment. Imagine not stopping, like in a race, until you cross the finish line.
While we shouldn't rely only on hope, hope is like a special kind of feeling that keeps us trying over and over again. It's like having a little voice inside that says, "I can do this" or "I can handle this challenge." But it's not about saying, "If I do this, that will definitely happen." 
Being patient is really important. Patience means waiting without getting too anxious. It's like waiting for your turn in a game. Sometimes, we need to wait for the right time, like when a cake needs time to bake in the oven. Taking time to understand things and think is really helpful. It's like when you have a puzzle, and you take your time to figure out where each piece goes. Time can also change things, just like the weather changes from sunny to rainy.
When we make decisions, it's smart to use our practical thinking and not let our feelings rush us. It's like thinking with our brain instead of just listening to our heart. We should focus on one thing at a time, depending on what's happening, and be okay with facing the truth. Sometimes, we might need to change our plans based on what's going on.
Listening to our inner voice is like having a secret friend inside us. When we spend quiet time, it's like having a little chat with that friend. Sometimes, we feel bad about things we did to ourselves, so saying sorry to ourselves can make us feel better. It's like giving yourself a hug. This helps us feel calm and strong inside.
As we keep doing these things and spending more time on them, we'll start to understand what's really happening around us. It's like putting together the pieces of a story to see the whole picture.
Think practically when making choices and be ready to face the truth. Listen to your inner voice and be kind to yourself. With time, you'll see things more clearly and understand what's really going on.
